# Olly's Cloudflare Toggle

At school, I use Cloudflare WARP ~~to bypass school restrictions~~ securely browse the internet 😏

Previously, I had a W*ndows installation, which CF provided a GUI application to interact with their system. However, that OS is icky, so I put Linux on my school Laptop, where there is no GUI application unless you use CF Zero Trust.

@junyali came up with the idea that I should write a GUI toggle to run the command to connect and disconnect my device from WARP without opening the terminal.

Currently, this is a WIP.

# Running this in a dev environment

Make sure that you have maven, then run the Launcher class' main method to start this in a dev environment. 

I will make a GitHub workflow that compiles each push into a jar file, and put a release out there with a compiled jar when I get to a point where I am happy!

<3 Happy Hacking
